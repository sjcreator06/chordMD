# chordMD

ChordMD is a single Python script that can be run to convert chords to the Nashville number system. The MD in the name stands for Music Director as the number system is the primary language of a Music Director in a band! This script will also output a formatted PDF. Currently, this script works well for CCM music, but in future updates, it can also be adapted to work for gospel and traditional Christian songs.
