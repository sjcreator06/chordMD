[Verse 1]
       G
All my words fall short
       Em
I got nothing new
          D
How could I express
      C
All my gratitude?
 
 
[Verse 2]
        G
I could sing these songs
     Em
As I often do
          D
But every song must end
       C
And You never do
 
 
[Chorus]
     G                                            D
So I throw up my hands and praise You again and again
 
'Cause all that I have is a
C            Em   D
Hallelujah   Hallelujah
      G                                                  D
And I know it's not much but I've nothing else fit for a King
 
Except for a heart singing
C           Em   D  G
Hallelujah  Hallelujah
 
 
[Verse 3]
         G
I've got one response
         Em
I've got just one move
        D
With my arm stretched wide
      C
I will worship You
 
 
[Chorus]
     G                                            D
So I throw up my hands and praise You again and again
 
'Cause all that I have is a
C           Em   D
Hallelujah  Hallelujah
      G                                                  D
And I know it's not much but I've nothing else fit for a King
 
Except for a heart singing
C           Em   D  G
Hallelujah  Hallelujah
