[Chorus]
             G
Christ is my firm foundation
    Em              D
The rock on which I stand
                 G
When everything around me is shaken
     Em              D
I’ve never been more glad
              C           G/B
That I put my faith in Jesus
            Em           D
‘Cause He’s never let me down
                      C       G/B
He’s faithful through generations
   Em              D
So why would He fail now
